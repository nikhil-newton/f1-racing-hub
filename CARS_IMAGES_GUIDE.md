- **Resolution**: Minimum 800x600px, Recommended 1200x800px
- **Aspect Ratio**: 3:2 or 4:3 works best

- **High quality** professional racing photos preferred
- **Clear visibility** of car livery and sponsor logos
- **Track or studio** background (avoid distracting backgrounds)
- **2025 season livery** - ensure cars show current season colors

## How to Add Images

1. **Download/Save** your F1 car images
2. **Rename** them according to the list above (e.g., `rb21.jpg`)
3. **Place** them in `public/cars/` directory
4. **Refresh** your application - images will automatically appear

## Data File Reference

Car image paths are defined in: `src/data/cars.ts`

Each car object has an `image` property:
```typescript
image: "/cars/rb21.jpg"  // Points to public/cars/rb21.jpg
```

## Current Status

üöß **Placeholder**: Currently showing car emoji (üèéÔ∏è) as placeholders
‚úÖ **Ready**: All data structures and paths are configured
‚è≥ **Pending**: Waiting for actual car images to be added

## Finding Quality Images

- **Team Official Websites**: Each team's media/press section
- **Getty Images**: Professional motorsport photography

### Important Notes
- Ensure you have rights to use any images
